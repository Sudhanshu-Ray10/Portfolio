# TODO for Fixing Routing Issue

- [ ] Update src/router.jsx to include all page routes (keep current for now, as pages are sections in Home)
- [ ] Update src/App.jsx to use Routes with motion wrappers instead of conditional rendering
- [ ] Modify src/pages/EntryGate.jsx to navigate to '/home' after entering and redirect if already entered
- [ ] Keep Navbar conditional on isEntered
- [ ] Run the app to verify "/" shows EntryGate and "/home" shows Home
